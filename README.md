# Athol Fugard

Athol Fugard is the website of Athol Fugard, the South African playwright, novelist, actor, and director, who is widely regarded as South Africa's greatest, most influential, and world acclaimed foremost playwright. The goal of the website is to let older and younger readers who are interested in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa and its literature to know more about Athol Fugard: his life, his protest theatre, and his significant contribution to the struggle of the oppressed black South Africans for freedom, a contribution that is made more pronounced by the fact that Fugard is white and had sacrificed this privileged position to side with and fight for the oppressed.

* Design
    * Color Scheme
    1. Orange
    2. Green
    3. White
        * The main color selected for this website is a tricolor of orange (code), green (code), and white (code). These colors a carefully selected for three reasons. First, to depict Athol Fugard’s heritage and identity. The colors selected are a tricolor of the national flag of Ireland. Fugard, though generally known as a South African, is by blood an Irish; his father was originally from Ireland. Second, the tricolor, just like the Irish flag, intends to also symbolise the “aspiration for unity between people of different colors and traditions” in South Africa, which is the concern of Fugard’s oeuvre. Third, the application of the tricolor to the website is for aesthetic nourishment: to make the website look beautiful in a way that it speaks to all visitors creatively. It is for this reason that the application of the three colors to the website, are not of equal size or in the same order as they are used on the Irish flag. Orange (code) is taken as the website’s main color and green and white are its secondary colours (black color whenever they are found on the website is treated as a default color). Thus, in terms of its third application, the tricolor holds no other meaning other than to please and to delight. 


    * Typography
        1. Roboto
        2. Sans-serif
            * The main font used for the website is Roboto with sans-serif as the fallback. Friendly and straightforward in appearance, Roboto is a “neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family. To keep things simple and clean, Roboto is the only font used throughout the website, but with varying sizes: bold 700 for headings and lower headings, and thin 100 for body text. The beauty of Roboto is that it is modern, contemporary, minimalistic, and highly readable and serves well for a writer’s website.
