                        <h2>Athol Fugard: Biography</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the preface to <em>My Life</em> (1994), Athol Fugard articulates the two basic needs that clearly inform and shape his theatre.  The first is his general concern with South African situation and the world around him.
                        </p>                  
                        <p> 
                            Fugard has expressed his frustration and impatience with “the middle aged and the ageing,” whom he has accused of being merely rhetorical and bombastic about the South African predicament, and articulates the urgent need for an alternative voice to be provided by the young South Africans.  He sees in the youth an appropriate and inevitable human and artistic vehicle that can be used to mould the future destiny of their country.
                        </p>                    
                        <p>
                            The other need is personal, his personal past and vision of a new South Africa.  As a theatre practitioner, it is Fugard’s thinking that the new political dispensation in South Africa requires a new artistic form.  He attempts to achieve this by the renewal of his faith in the spoken word.  
                        </p>                   
                        <p>
                            Fugard’s position is that his entire writing career has been an attempt to bring the above two elements: youths and words, into a form of harmony.

                        <h2>Fugard: Aesthetic vision of Theatre</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the preface to <em>My Life</em> (1994), Athol Fugard articulates the two basic needs that clearly inform and shape his theatre.  The first is his general concern with South African situation and the world around him.
                    </p>                   
                    <p> 
                        Fugard has expressed his frustration and impatience with “the middle aged and the ageing,” whom he has accused of being merely rhetorical and bombastic about the South African predicament, and articulates the urgent need for an alternative voice to be provided by the young South Africans.  He sees in the youth an appropriate and inevitable human and artistic vehicle that can be used to mould the future destiny of their country.
                    </p>

                        The other need is personal, his personal past and vision of a new South Africa.  As a theatre practitioner, it is Fugard’s thinking that the new political dispensation in South Africa requires a new artistic form.

                    <p>
                        Fugard’s position is that his entire writing career has been an attempt to bring the above two elements: youths and words, into a form of harmony. But tied to these two basic needs is Fugard’s aesthetic vision of the theatre to bear witness, on behalf of the oppressed black South Africans, to the insufferable human conditions, the psychological struggles of the individuals to overcome these conditions and the role of art and the artists in the critical moment of the South African desperate situations to achieve freedom.
